Web storage: 

    Website Dependant,
     Forever storage

    localStorage.setItem('name',"Shubham")
    localStorage.getItem("name")

Session storage

    Website Dependent, session Dependant

    sessionStorage.setItem('name',"Shubham")
    sessionStorage.getItem("name")

Cookies

    Data store...
    stores key value pairs

    Cookies are page Dependant
    mapped to the Website

    communicates to servers, sends itself to servers
    is similiar to local/session storage but it can be sent with 
        a webpage to servers

    We can give expiry time in Cookies
    ex: login time...expires in 30 days..google/facebook
    acts as a security feature 

Working:

Check if main is initialized or not

        If yes, nevermind...
        If no, Set item with key = 'main' and value = ''
            in local storage

We will be using a string 'list' to do string operations

setCookie 
    
    1) Take Input(key,value)
    2) Check if 'main' is empty or not...
            If yes, Save 'key' in "main" and "list" 
            If no, Save 'key' in "list" and 
                re-set the value of "main" = "list"

    3) Take 2nd input(key,value)
    4) Append 2nd key to the 1st key, add a comma and Save it 
       again to main


Working(2.0):

       again to main

Bug Discussion

1) deleteCookie()

    Problem arises when multiple keys have to be deleted

2) ListCookise()

    "undefined" is popping up first, I have no idea why
